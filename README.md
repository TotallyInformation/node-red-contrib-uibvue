# node-red-contrib-uibvue
An extension to uibuilder that uses VueJS to help build user interfaces in conjunction with Node-RED.

See the [GitHub WIKI](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/node-red-contrib-uibvue/wiki) for design information.

uibuilder provides a simple base for building user interfaces that interact via Node-RED. It makes it very easy to create your own custom interface using whatever front-end frameworks you like - or indeed no framework at all!

However, it can be daunting for beginners and people without web coding skills to create interfaces this way. So `uibvue` is the next step. It will provide a number of standard components with defined data schema's that will make it easier to create interfaces. Greatly reducing the amount of code that you need to deal with. Each component will have a matching Node-RED node that can be dropped into a flow.
